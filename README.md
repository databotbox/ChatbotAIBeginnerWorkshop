# Chatbot AI Beginner Workshop with Data Bot Box and Bitfusion!

Welcome to our repository!

Here you can find materials for our artificial intelligence driven Chatbot Workshops.  The first set of materials is for our beginner's workshop.
You will find the following:
1. Slides from our presentation can be found here: [Slides from Data Bot Box and Bitfusion Beginner's Workshop](http://bit.ly/2quMDcw)
2. Data to create your own generative dialog chatbot
3. Code or links to get you started making your own chatbot.

Specifically for this workshop we suggest that you first read through and do the Tensorflow tutorial on Seq-to-Seq.  This tutorial teaches how to make a English to French translator.  It is the first step generally used in a Seq-to-Seq chatbot running off tensor flow.

Practical Seq-to-Seq chatbot based upon twitter data here: [Suryia's Practicial Seq-2-Seq Chatbot](http://suriyadeepan.github.io/2016-12-31-practical-seq2seq/ ) 

Your 'homework' assignments are listed below.  The first assignment, a Snarky Reddit Chatbot, is the same as Stanford University homework assignment found here: [Stanford Course Homework Slides](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/lectures/slides_13.pdf).  Our second homework assignment is to take the Cornell movie dialog corpus with has movie dialog lines.  The assignment is then to make a generative dialog or narrative bot that can obtain the correct or an correct movie dialog response!  This is a funny 'game' chatbot.
To help you make a chatbot that runs off of Reddit data and the movie dialog corpus, we have provided a 'naughty word' filter and code for your convenience so you can make your bots PG-13.

Just for fun, here's a video of Cookie Monster's 'Shower Thoughts' [Cookie Monster Shower Thoughts](https://youtu.be/wBNJ0BH3Dgs) Dataset May 2015](ww.kaggle.com/reddit/reddit-comments-may-2015) which is what your Reddit chatbot uses for training data.  We also uploaded a sub-reddit dataset from May of 2015 that lists only Shower Thoughts dialog.

Happy coding and have fun! In a few weeks we will post or send out the code for making the Reddit chatbot -- we just thought we would give you a chance to try it on your own.  The code will require a password for access, as we don't want to give away Stanford's homework assignment!
